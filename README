libdnet
-------

libdnet provides a simplified, portable interface to several low-level
networking routines, including network address manipulation, kernel
arp(4) cache and route(4) table lookup and manipulation, network
firewalling, network interface lookup and manipulation, IP tunnelling,
and raw IP packet and Ethernet frame transmission.

N.B: This version is specific to FreeBSD and very much trimmed down from the
original implementation.
