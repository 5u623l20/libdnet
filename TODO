ipfw2 on FreeBSD 11.X/12.X/HEAD

optimize port wildcard rules for each firewall type - e.g. using ipf
FR_NONE, pf PF_OP_NONE, etc.

audit addr_ntos() for non-zero'd host bits

make *_loop() prevent modification within loop, or modify only
post-iteration

prefix everything with dnet_*, maybe new API with common dnet_t handle?

more documentation and example code

add a way to enable ip forwarding?

finish IPv6 support everywhere (fw, route, ip6 etc.)

NAT, ipsec interface?

maybe Checkpoint FW-1 support, via OPSEC (hrr)

  = works, tested	1 = ipfw support, but no ipfw2
? = untested
- = unimplemented

eth_send() doesn't allow src mac spoofing on MacOS X (no
BIOCSHDRCMPLT) without patch (http://slagheap.net/etherspoof/),
also b0rked on BSD/OS, says markus. not possible on Tru64?

no support for ICMP code in ipfw, therefore none in fw-ipfw.c
